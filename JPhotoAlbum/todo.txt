- photoshow should listen for changes in collection
- collections should notify each other, e.g. for cover photo change
- rotate image & thumb (optionally using exif headers?)
- zoom image (1:1, fit vert, fit horiz)
- crop image (4:3, 3:2 rectangles)
- CGI to display frame targets with correct colors and Exif info
- link to other jph files (preferably from description)
- convert old XML files to JPH, remove extra linefeeds from text
- NO NEED, webstart has console: log to file if property "webstart" set
- trace log window
- AWT-only photoshow, perhaps an applet, too
- subtitled export sizes 1024x768, 1280x1024, 1600x1200 (e.g. screen savers)
- favicon.ico for photos and jpkware.com
- windows installer with .jph bindings etc
- export from multiple frames causes major problems, due to static status
