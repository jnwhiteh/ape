<p><a href="jph.jnlp">JPhotoAlbum</a> is a Java desktop application for
quickly browsing, organizing and commenting digital photographs and
publishing the resulting albums as web pages. Albums are saved in XML
formatted files whic are transformed to HTML with XML stylesheets.

<p>The photos in <a href="http://photos.jpkware.com/">photos.jpkware.com</a>
have been organized and published using this program.

<p>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.4.1 or later is required to run
JPhotoAlbum: you can download it from <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>

<p>The easiest way to <a href="jph.jnlp">run JPhotoAlbum</a> is using Java
Web Start. Simply <a href="jph.jnlp">click here</a> to download and run the
program (you just have to trust it by clicking Start since I don't have a
certificate from any global name authority). The Java Web Start will make
sure that you are always running the latest version (you can still run it
off-line as well, it just won't get updated until you connect again).

<p> See the Help/Contents in the program menu to get started with the
program!</p>

<p>You can also install a local copy, simply download <a
 href="jph.zip">jph.zip</a> and unzip it to a single directory, then use
 command "java -jar JPhotoAlbum.jar" to start the JPhotoAlbum. In Windows
 you can also start it by double clicking the JPhotoAlbum.jar. The zip file
 contains the following packages (note that the JPhotoAlbum.jar inside the
 zip file may be a bit old, if the Help/About version is older than listed
 in the version history below, please update it from the link below):

<ul>
  <li><a href="JPhotoAlbum.jar">JPhotoAlbum.jar</a>
- the main program, you may want to update only this file after you have
downloaded the full package once. Use right-click the link and use Save As
if the browser shows binary garbage otherwise.<br>
  </li>
  <li>castor.jar: download from <a href="http://castor.exolab.org/">http://castor.exolab.org/</a>,
preferably castor-0.9.4.3.jar, and rename it to castor.jar</li>
  <li>metadata-extractor-2.2.2.jar: download from <a
 href="http://drewnoakes.com/code/exif/">http://drewnoakes.com/code/exif/</a> <br>
  </li>
  <li>xerces.jar: Xerces Java 1 from <a href="http://xml.apache.org/">http://xml.apache.org/</a>,
preferably version 1.3.1, and rename it to xerces.jar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version history</h2>

</li>

<li>1.4.3 Added sharpening of output photos using the UnSharpMask library by <a href="http://jedah.laatikko.org/jalbum/">Janne Kipin&auml;</a>.

Moved JavaScripts used in Thumbnails to parent frame.
</li>

<li>1.2.3 Fixed a few additional bugs in album linking and loading.
Reordered page menu. Fixed non-black-and-white foreground and background
colors, changed default colors to be black on a bit yellowish white.
Prevented multiple simultaneous exports. Save album before export only if
album modified or no name. Framed album now uses JavaScript to implement
next/previous links and colors on image frame, and the frame is also
generated with a stylesheet.
</li>

the slow (sometimes VERY slow) getScaledInstance() method. Added 
"Find original photos".
</li>
<li>1.1.7 Subtitled images are named "albumnameNNN.ext" where the NNN
is the index of the photo in the album. This way they are shown in
album order even if the player reorders them by file name. Added
text elements without an image.
</li>
<li>1.1.6 Fixed scrollpane initial size problems. Drop to fullview
panel works, too.
</li>

shows it in a full screen view. "show" command line option added.

a few missing dispose() calls. Keep small images in normal size in
full screen view. Handle GIFs correctly, and accept them from drops,
too.
</li>
<li>1.1.3 Load thumbs in a background thread, also generate thumbs for
files without Exif info. Show description (if defined) in thumbnail
instead of file name. Remember JPG import directory during one session.
</li>
<li>1.1.2 Fixed help and table export with web start. Moved subtitles
30 pixels right to compensate some TV's off-center display, increased
font size. Added "export *.jph" command line option.
