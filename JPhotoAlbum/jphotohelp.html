<h1>JPhotoAlbum Help</h1>

JPhotoAlbum allows quick browsing, organizing and commenting digital photographs 
and publishing the resulting albums as web pages. Albums are saved in XML
formatted files which are transformed to HTML with XML stylesheets.

<h2>Running JPhotoAlbum</h2>

JPhotoAlbum can be started with command "java -jar JPhotoAlbum.jar".
The supporting jar files castor.jar, exif-extractor-2.1.jar and xerces.jar
must be in the same directory as the JPhotoAlbum.jar. In Windows you can
also start JPhotoAlbum by double clicking the JPhotoAlbum.jar. See below 
for various command line options.

<h2>Creating albums</h2>

Create a new album by selecting File/New.

<p/>Use "File/Import photos from a directory..." to import all photos
in a directory.

<p/>Use "File/Import selected photos..." to select photographs in JPG
or GIF format into the album. Note that you can select multiple
photographs at the same time by holding down the control key.

<p/>You can use Import commands multiple times, the new photos are
added after the currently selected photo.

<p/>"Find original photos" is useful when the original photos have
moved since you created the JPH file. Select the new directory which
holds the originals, and JPhotoAlbum will search for files whose file
name matches to those in the current album. You can select this
multiple times if the originals are now in multiple directories.

<p/>You can also drag and drop one or more photos from an external file
manager, e.g. Windows Explorer.

<p/>You can also quickly create an album from a set of photos in a directory
by listing them as parameters when starting JPhotoAlbum on
command line, e.g. "java -jar JPhotoAlbum.jar /photos/*.jpg".

<p/>Save the album using the File/Save option. The default extension
for JPhoto albums is .jph.

<h2>Editing albums</h2>

You can load existing albums with File/Open or by entering the
album name as a command line parameter when starting the program.

<p/>The photographs can be reordered by cutting selected photographs
and then pasting them to a new location. Normal keyboard shortcuts
work as well.

<p/>The photographs can be reordered with drag and drop. First click
the photograph you want to move, then press mouse button down and drag
while holding it down. Release when the blue selection is in a correct
place.

<p/>You can add descriptive text to photographs by entering it into the
edit field above the photograph area. While the focus is in the edit
field, Enter will save the edit and move to next photograph. Up and
Down arrow can also be used to move to previous and next photo.

<p/>You can add text only panels for descriptions without photos.

<p/>Various page properties can be edited using the Page menu. These can be
referred to from the page templates. The watermark is written to the lower
left corner of web images, it is useful for embedding copyright to
published images. Note that this watermark is written to images only when
they are generated. You must delete the images in "pictures" subdirectory
to regenerate them with new watermark.

The current properties can be saved as defaults, then new albums will be
created with those values.

<p/>You can link albums together by using Edit/Insert Link to Album or
dropping a JPH file to album. The title of the linked album is taken
as default text, and the cover photo of the album is shown. Text can
be edited, if the title is not suitable (original title is not
changed). The cover photo can be set from page properties. Double
clicking the album link will open it in another JPhotoAlbum window.

<h2>Exporting HTML</h2>

The File/Export HTML provides different HTML output formats. The album
is automatically saved before starting any export operations.

<p/>The HTML albums will contain images resized to fit into a 640 times
640 pixel square, and optionally thumbnails are also generated. The
generation of there pictures may take a long time if there are a 
lot of large photos, but it will be done only once, unless generated 
images are deleted manually.

<p/>The HTML file is generated to the same directory as the saved album
file. The scaled images are saved to <code>pictures</code> and
<code>thumbs</code> subdirectories. Some supporting HTML pages may be
saved to <code>html</code> subdirectory.

<h2>Exporting Subtitled Photos</h2>

<p/>The Export Subtitled Photos option can be used to export photos so
that they fit in a 640 times 480 pixel rectangle, even if they are in
potrait form factor. The description is added over the image and the
result is saved to <code>subtitled</code> subdirectory. These photos
are useful when you will burn the photos on a CD for viewing on TV.
This export option generates the photos every time from original
images, unlike the HTML export methods which generate the pictures and
thumbs only if they do not exist.

<p/>You can also export albums from command line, e.g. "java -jar
JPhotoAlbum.jar export *.jph". This command will export the photos
from all album files using all HTML methods as well as the Subtitled
method. You can also export using only selected methods by adding their
shortcut numbers to export command, e.g. export02 will export Subtitled
photos and Framed Thumbnails.

<h2>Modifying HTML templates</h2>

The Export Template option can be used to save the default templates
for generating the HTML pages to files. These templates can then be
edited with any text editor to create custom look&amp;feels for some
albums. See the status line for the exact name of the template used by
each output format. Note that some export options share templates, so
you should export all templates to the same target directory before
you start editing them.

<p/>The Export HTML operations try to find the templates from the
output directory, and failing to find them there, then also from the
parent directory of the output directory. Otherwise the default
templates from the program Jar file are used.

<h2>Creating an index of all photos</h2>

The Export Index of all Linked Albums will genenerate a single page which 
contains thumbnails of all images in all albums linked from this album.
Those thumbnails will be links to the actual framed HTML page containing 
the image with anchors pointing to the actual image. All the framed HTML
pages must be still be generated using the Export HTML/Framed Thumbnails. 
The index file will be named "albumname-all.html".

<h2>Viewing slideshow</h2>

The currently open photo album can be viewed as a slide show by
selecting View/Slideshow. The program will show the photos one after
another in full screen mode, with description shown in the bottom as
sub-titling.

<p/>Each photo is shown for 5 seconds. Up and down arrows can be used
to return to previous photos or skip to next photo. Esc will cancel
the slide show.

<p/>Slideshow can be started start from command line with command "show
album.jph".

<h2>Exporting SlideShow</h2>

The images can also be resized and exported to a single .JAR file which
can be double clicked to view them as a slideshow using the File/Export
Slideshow. The size of the images in JAR file can be selected, the images 
will always be scaled to fit the screen when showing them. 

<h2>Viewing EXIF information</h2>

The EXIF information is created by the digital camera when the picture is
taken. It includes exposure information like aperture and exposure time as 
well other information. You can view this by selecting the View/Exif information
menu option. The dialog remains open until you close it.

<h2>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
<p/>
Version 2, June 1991

<p/>

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

</p>
<p>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</p>
<p>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

</p>
<p>

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

</p>
<p>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

</p>
<p>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

</p>
<p>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

</p>
<p>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.


</p>


<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h2>


<p/>

<strong>0.</strong>
 This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<p/>

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<p/>

<strong>1.</strong>
 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
<p/>

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<p/>

<strong>2.</strong>
 You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

<ul>

<li><strong>a)</strong>
     You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
</li>

<li><strong>b)</strong>
     You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.
</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong>
     If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</li>
</ul>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<p/>

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
<p/>

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<p/>

<strong>3.</strong>
 You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:


<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
<!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
<ul>

<li><strong>a)</strong>
     Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong>
     Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,
</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong>
     Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
     received the program in object code or executable form with such
     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</li>
</ul>

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

<p/>

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<p/>

<strong>4.</strong>
 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<p/>

<strong>5.</strong>
 You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

<p/>

<strong>6.</strong>
 Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<p/>

<strong>7.</strong>
 If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<p/>

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
<p/>

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
<p/>

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<p/>

<strong>8.</strong>
 If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

<p/>

<strong>9.</strong>
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<p/>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.


<p/>


<strong>10.</strong>
 If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



<p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

<p/>

<strong>11.</strong>
 BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<p/>

<strong>12.</strong>
 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
